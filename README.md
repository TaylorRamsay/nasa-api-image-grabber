# nasa-api-image-grabber
## What is it?
This python program queries NASA's [EPIC](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/) API (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) to download the most recent full disc imagery of the Earth. It then converts these images into a .gif to simulate the Earths rotation.

## How does it work?
This python script makes use of [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/) which proides free access to data such as [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and [NASA's Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html)!

## Why?
This small project was to familiarize myself with the usage of an API, manipulating the requested data, and using that data for a specific goal. In this case the goal was to collect images of the Earth and simulate its rotation in .gif format.
